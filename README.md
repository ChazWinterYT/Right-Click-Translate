This is a Google Chrome Extension that adds a "Translate selected text" option to your right click menu.
When clicked, it opens a new tab with Google Translate, and translates the selected text to English

TODO: I want to add a config menu where you can change the target language (so it's not always English by default).
Once I can figure that out, I will submit this extension to Google.

TO INSTALL: 
* Download the right-click-translate folder and all of its contents. 
* Open Google Chrome, go to the URL chrome://extensions/
* Enable Developer Mode (usually in the top left corner. If not, then Google "How to enable Developer Mode")
* At the top of the screen, click "Load unpacked"
* Select the folder you downloaded in step 1. Done!
